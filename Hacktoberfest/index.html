        <p>
            Every October, over 100k participants from all over the world participate in Hacktoberfest by going on
            GitHub, choosing a repository, and contributing to it.

            Contributions are done by submitting a pull request (PR) to any repository that is participating in
            Hacktoberfest. Once your pull request is deemed accepted (we'll go over how that works in the next
            sections), it will count into your participation in Hacktoberfest.

            To successfully participate in Hacktoberfest, you will need to submit at least 4 accepted pull requests to
            any repositories that are participating in Hacktoberfest.

            Once Hacktoberfest is over, which is at the end of October, the first 55,000 participants to have submitted
            at least 4 accepted pull requests will receive a t-shirt with a swag pack. And, starting this year,
            maintainers will be able to receive swag packs as well!

            Although receiving a free t-shirt is always cool, there are more important reasons to participate in
            Hacktoberfest. Whether you are a maintainer or a participant, you will surely learn and benefit a lot from
            Hacktoberfest.

        <h3>As a Maintainer</h3>
        <p class="bullet">
            As a repository maintainer, Hacktoberfest allows you to grow your community. By participating in
            Hacktoberfest, your repository will receive more traffic from developers who are looking to participate.

            So, even when Hacktoberfest ends, if these developers liked the experience of contributing to your
            repository, they will come back to help with more issues.

            Managing an open-source project can be hard, especially since you might lack the time to improve and expand
            on the project as a maintainer. So, Hacktoberfest is a great time to receive help on issues that have been
            pending for a while or enhancements that can be done to improve your project.
        </p>
        <h3>As a Participant</h3>  
        <p class="bullet">
               Whether you're a beginner or not, there's always room for learning and expanding your knowledge. One of the
            best ways to do that is by contributing to open-source projects.

            Open-source projects usually provide tools, libraries, or other types of resourceful services for the
            community for free. Contributing to them and helping them to keep going is helpful for the community, and
            ultimately for yourself.

            As each project is different, each might rely on different programming languages, frameworks, tools, or
            other types of resources they use or provide. By contributing to them, you'll take the time to check how it
            works, what they use, and so on. You also take the time to solve a problem or an issue in the project or
            bring new enhancements to the table.

            So, when you contribute you're also taking on new challenges to solve, which is a great way to learn and
            practice your skills.

            If you're a beginner, by participating in Hacktoberfest, you can finally get over any fear you might have
            that is stopping you from contributing to open source projects. It was through Hacktoberfest that I finally
            started my journey in contributing to open source projects.
